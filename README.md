# Driver Download Guide

Goto the Lenovo product search page [here](http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/GlobalProductSelector?C=1&TabName&linkTrack#), and find the correct model. Select the desired operating system and click "Show More" at the bottom of the page.

Change the Chrome download directory to the target directory. Run `setup.bat` to copy the Javascript command to the clipboard (this also runs a few other necessary commands). Run the command on the Chrome console (`Ctrl + Shift + J`, `Ctrl + V`, `Enter`) on the driver download page, and paste the Javascript into the console.

NOTE: The Javascript command will open 30+ new Chrome tabs; it is recommended that you do this in a new window (so you can close all of the tabs at once when you are finished).
