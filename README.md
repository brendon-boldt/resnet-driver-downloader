# Driver Download Guide

Lenovo Product search page: [http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/GlobalProductSelector?C=1&TabName&linkTrack#](http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/GlobalProductSelector?C=1&TabName&linkTrack#)

Go to the Lenovo product search page [here](http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/GlobalProductSelector?C=1&TabName&linkTrack#), and find the correct model. Select the desired operating system and click "Show More" at the bottom of the page.

Change the Chrome download directory to the target directory. Run `setup.bat` to copy the JavaScript command to the clipboard or copy directly from `links.js`. Run the command on the Chrome console __(`Ctrl + Shift + J`, `Ctrl + V`, `Enter`)__ on the driver download page, and paste the JavaScript into the console. _You may have to disable popups and rerun the JavaScript command_.

NOTE: The Javascript command will open 30+ new Chrome tabs; it is recommended that you do this in a new window (so you can close all of the tabs at once when you are finished).
